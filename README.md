## Description
An example app for getting list of files and directories on device was made as a job test task.

Application is built according to the principles of SOLID and [Ð¡lean architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). MVVM is used as a design pattern. MVI based on MVVM and Kotlin Coroutines [StateFlow](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-state-flow/) and implemented via [Orbit Multiplatform](https://orbit-mvi.org/) library

## Architecture
All application modules are presented in the diagram:

![Application modules scheme](docs/images/schemes/connections_list_modules.svg)

Application separated into different modules according to "core"-"feature" separation. Most of "feature" modules are divided into "api" and "implementation" to create an opportunity for different "feature" modules to be dependent from other "feature" modules via some "API" without certain implementation.
